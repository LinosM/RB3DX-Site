<h2 style="text-align: center">Rock Band 3 Decompilation</h2>

<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>
    This is a reverse engineering project aimed at producing a <b>functionally equivalent</b> decompilation of the Wii version of <i>Rock Band 3</i>. This process involves writing C++ code that when compiled, produces similar code that is in the final release of the game.
</p>

<p>
    The end result of all of this will be a fully editable version of the game's code in human-readable C++. This will allow for modifications to be made beyond what we can already do in <i>Rock Band 3 Deluxe</i>.
</p>

<h1>Why the Wii version?</h1>
<p>
    It's quite simply a matter of this being the only version of the game where an accurate decompilation is even viable to produce. Other versions have went through a process called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization>Link-Time Optimization</a> that makes the code faster, but for us this has the massive downside of making an accurate decompilation project completely infeasible.
</p>

<h1>How can I contribute?</h1>
<p>
    You may contribute <a href="https://github.com/darkrta/rb3">here</a>. We are always looking for more contributors to push the project forward.
</p>

<h1>What about a port?</h1>
<p>
    Let's preface this by saying that decompilation projects are <i>NOT</i> ports. With that being said, this is a very rare case where the people working on the decompilation project are also those interested in porting the codebase to more platforms.
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind this process takes an extremely long time, and we will not be making any attempt at a port until the game is fully decompiled. If you really want a port to be made faster and you have the technical know-how (or are willing to learn), you should consider contributing to the project.
</p>

<h1>Will you be able to do [modification] with this?</h1>
<p>
    Theoretically yes, but such modifications are completely outside of the scope of this project. This project only concerns itself with producing readable C++ code that can be used to create said modifications.
